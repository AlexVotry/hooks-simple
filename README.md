this is a quick app to explore using hooks.  Typically to access state or lifecycle methods, we use class components.

In this example I use functional components to access state and lifecycle method.

I created a `useResourcs.js` file to be reused with two different components.  I kept everything really simple to focus just on the use of the hooks: `useState` and `useEffect`.

No effort was made on UI or UX, this was just an exercise to understand how hooks work, and the possible advantages of them.
